# Manifest Evolution Log

This document tracks changes to the proposed final manifest as the project evolves.

## Initial Version - 2025-07-03

### Source
Created from initial project planning and MVP requirements analysis.

### Key Components
- MQTTNotePlugin - Main plugin class managing lifecycle
- MQTTClient - MQTT broker connection and message handling
- NotePublisher - Handles note-to-MQTT publishing with frontmatter detection
- NoteCreator - Creates notes from MQTT messages in specified folder
- MQTTNoteSettingTab - Settings UI for broker configuration

### Architecture Decisions
- Two-way communication system with separate publisher/creator classes
- Frontmatter-based publishing trigger (mqtt: true)
- Topic generation from note title with configurable prefix
- JSON payload format containing frontmatter and body content
- Configurable folder for incoming message notes
- Settings persistence through Obsidian's plugin data system

### Key Features
- Automatic publishing on save (configurable)
- Manual publishing via command palette
- MQTT message subscription with note creation
- Broker connection management with retry logic
- Settings UI for complete configuration

### Future Updates
Updates will be logged here as the project evolves and we learn from implementation.

## Manifest Update v1.1 - 2025-07-04

### Trigger
Completion of Phase 2: Core MQTT Functionality (Tasks 2.1-2.2) with significant architectural discoveries during implementation.

### Key Changes
- **Enhanced MQTTClient Architecture**: Updated to reflect EventEmitter inheritance with event-driven communication pattern
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic with comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **MQTT Wildcard Support**: Implemented + and # wildcard topic matching for flexible subscription patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Added complete test suite with real broker connectivity validation
- **Updated API Signatures**: Enhanced method signatures with better type support and JSON serialization
- **Testing Integration**: Added test scripts to package.json and comprehensive test documentation

### Reason for Changes
During implementation of Tasks 2.1-2.2, several architectural improvements emerged that significantly enhance the robustness and functionality of the MQTT client beyond the original planned scope:

1. **EventEmitter Pattern**: Discovered that async communication patterns work much better with event-driven architecture
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Real-world testing revealed need for sophisticated reconnection logic and error recovery
3. **Wildcard Support**: Implementation showed importance of flexible topic subscription patterns
4. **Testing Validation**: Need for comprehensive testing against real brokers became apparent for production readiness

### Impact Assessment
- **Existing Tasks**: No breaking changes to planned tasks; all future tasks benefit from enhanced MQTT client
- **Architecture**: Stronger foundation with event-driven patterns and robust error handling
- **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies; enhanced use of Node.js EventEmitter
- **Timeline**: No impact on timeline; enhancements were implemented within original task scope

### Lessons Learned
- **EventEmitter Integration**: Event-driven patterns provide much cleaner async communication than callback-only approaches
- **Real-world Testing**: Live broker testing revealed edge cases not apparent in planning phase
- **Error Recovery**: Network reliability requires sophisticated reconnection strategies with exponential backoff
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suites with real broker connectivity are essential for production readiness
- **API Design**: Object-based parameters (MQTTNoteSettings) are more maintainable than multiple primitive parameters
- **Wildcard Patterns**: MQTT wildcard support (+, #) is crucial for flexible subscription architectures

### Quality Improvements
- **Robustness**: Enhanced error handling and reconnection logic
- **Maintainability**: Event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with real-world scenario validation
- **Flexibility**: Wildcard support enables more sophisticated subscription patterns
- **Documentation**: Detailed API documentation with implementation examples

## Manifest Update v1.2 - 2025-07-04

### Trigger
Completion of Phase 3: Note Publishing (Tasks 3.1-3.3) with comprehensive outgoing note publishing functionality including auto-publishing capabilities.

### Key Changes
- **Complete Note Publisher Implementation**: Full NotePublisher class with frontmatter parsing, topic generation, and payload creation
- **Auto-Publishing System**: File modification event listeners with intelligent debouncing to prevent spam publishing
- **Enhanced Main Plugin Class**: Extended MQTTNotePlugin with comprehensive lifecycle management and event handling
- **Manual Publishing Integration**: Command palette integration with user feedback systems
- **Debouncing Architecture**: Map-based debounce tracking with per-file timeout management
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and debounce timers on plugin unload

### Reason for Changes
Phase 3 implementation revealed the need for sophisticated auto-publishing mechanisms and comprehensive lifecycle management:

1. **Debouncing System**: File modification events fire rapidly during editing, requiring intelligent debouncing to prevent MQTT spam
2. **Event Management**: Proper setup and cleanup of file modification listeners is crucial for plugin stability
3. **User Experience**: Manual publishing commands need comprehensive feedback systems with success/error notifications
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Auto-publishing must be resource-efficient with no memory leaks from uncleaned timers

### Implementation Discoveries
- **File Modification Events**: Obsidian's vault.on('modify') events require careful handling to avoid performance issues
- **Frontmatter Parsing**: Custom YAML parsing is needed to avoid heavy dependencies while maintaining reliability
- **Topic Sanitization**: MQTT topic generation requires careful character sanitization for compliance
- **Error Handling**: Auto-publishing should fail silently to avoid notification spam while logging errors

### Impact Assessment
- **Existing Tasks**: No breaking changes; enhanced foundation for Phase 4 (MQTT â†’ Obsidian)
- **Architecture**: Complete outgoing data flow with both manual and automatic publishing paths
- **Performance**: Debouncing system ensures efficient MQTT usage without spam
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with Obsidian workflow including command palette

### Quality Improvements
- **Auto-Publishing**: Intelligent debouncing prevents MQTT broker spam
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and performance degradation
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of MQTT disconnections and parsing errors
- **User Feedback**: Comprehensive notification system for publishing operations
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation between manual and automatic publishing workflows

### Lessons Learned
- **Debouncing Strategy**: Per-file debouncing with Map tracking is more efficient than global debouncing
- **Event Listener Cleanup**: Critical to prevent memory leaks and plugin conflicts
- **Auto-Publish Logic**: Should respect user settings and fail gracefully without user disruption
- **MQTT Integration**: Connection status checks prevent unnecessary error scenarios
- **Frontmatter Handling**: Custom parsing provides better control than external YAML dependencies
