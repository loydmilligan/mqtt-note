# Manifest Evolution Log

This document tracks changes to the proposed final manifest as the project evolves.

## Initial Version - 2025-07-03

### Source
Created from initial project planning and MVP requirements analysis.

### Key Components
- MQTTNotePlugin - Main plugin class managing lifecycle
- MQTTClient - MQTT broker connection and message handling
- NotePublisher - Handles note-to-MQTT publishing with frontmatter detection
- NoteCreator - Creates notes from MQTT messages in specified folder
- MQTTNoteSettingTab - Settings UI for broker configuration

### Architecture Decisions
- Two-way communication system with separate publisher/creator classes
- Frontmatter-based publishing trigger (mqtt: true)
- Topic generation from note title with configurable prefix
- JSON payload format containing frontmatter and body content
- Configurable folder for incoming message notes
- Settings persistence through Obsidian's plugin data system

### Key Features
- Automatic publishing on save (configurable)
- Manual publishing via command palette
- MQTT message subscription with note creation
- Broker connection management with retry logic
- Settings UI for complete configuration

### Future Updates
Updates will be logged here as the project evolves and we learn from implementation.

## Manifest Update v1.1 - 2025-07-04

### Trigger
Completion of Phase 2: Core MQTT Functionality (Tasks 2.1-2.2) with significant architectural discoveries during implementation.

### Key Changes
- **Enhanced MQTTClient Architecture**: Updated to reflect EventEmitter inheritance with event-driven communication pattern
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic with comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **MQTT Wildcard Support**: Implemented + and # wildcard topic matching for flexible subscription patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Added complete test suite with real broker connectivity validation
- **Updated API Signatures**: Enhanced method signatures with better type support and JSON serialization
- **Testing Integration**: Added test scripts to package.json and comprehensive test documentation

### Reason for Changes
During implementation of Tasks 2.1-2.2, several architectural improvements emerged that significantly enhance the robustness and functionality of the MQTT client beyond the original planned scope:

1. **EventEmitter Pattern**: Discovered that async communication patterns work much better with event-driven architecture
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Real-world testing revealed need for sophisticated reconnection logic and error recovery
3. **Wildcard Support**: Implementation showed importance of flexible topic subscription patterns
4. **Testing Validation**: Need for comprehensive testing against real brokers became apparent for production readiness

### Impact Assessment
- **Existing Tasks**: No breaking changes to planned tasks; all future tasks benefit from enhanced MQTT client
- **Architecture**: Stronger foundation with event-driven patterns and robust error handling
- **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies; enhanced use of Node.js EventEmitter
- **Timeline**: No impact on timeline; enhancements were implemented within original task scope

### Lessons Learned
- **EventEmitter Integration**: Event-driven patterns provide much cleaner async communication than callback-only approaches
- **Real-world Testing**: Live broker testing revealed edge cases not apparent in planning phase
- **Error Recovery**: Network reliability requires sophisticated reconnection strategies with exponential backoff
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suites with real broker connectivity are essential for production readiness
- **API Design**: Object-based parameters (MQTTNoteSettings) are more maintainable than multiple primitive parameters
- **Wildcard Patterns**: MQTT wildcard support (+, #) is crucial for flexible subscription architectures

### Quality Improvements
- **Robustness**: Enhanced error handling and reconnection logic
- **Maintainability**: Event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with real-world scenario validation
- **Flexibility**: Wildcard support enables more sophisticated subscription patterns
- **Documentation**: Detailed API documentation with implementation examples
