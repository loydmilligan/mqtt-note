## Manifest Update v1.2 - 2025-07-04

### Trigger
Completion of Phase 3: Note Publishing (Tasks 3.1-3.3) with comprehensive outgoing note publishing functionality including auto-publishing capabilities.

### Key Changes
- **Complete Note Publisher Implementation**: Full NotePublisher class with frontmatter parsing, topic generation, and payload creation
- **Auto-Publishing System**: File modification event listeners with intelligent debouncing to prevent spam publishing
- **Enhanced Main Plugin Class**: Extended MQTTNotePlugin with comprehensive lifecycle management and event handling
- **Manual Publishing Integration**: Command palette integration with user feedback systems
- **Debouncing Architecture**: Map-based debounce tracking with per-file timeout management
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and debounce timers on plugin unload

### Reason for Changes
Phase 3 implementation revealed the need for sophisticated auto-publishing mechanisms and comprehensive lifecycle management:

1. **Debouncing System**: File modification events fire rapidly during editing, requiring intelligent debouncing to prevent MQTT spam
2. **Event Management**: Proper setup and cleanup of file modification listeners is crucial for plugin stability
3. **User Experience**: Manual publishing commands need comprehensive feedback systems with success/error notifications
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Auto-publishing must be resource-efficient with no memory leaks from uncleaned timers

### Implementation Discoveries
- **File Modification Events**: Obsidian's vault.on('modify') events require careful handling to avoid performance issues
- **Frontmatter Parsing**: Custom YAML parsing is needed to avoid heavy dependencies while maintaining reliability
- **Topic Sanitization**: MQTT topic generation requires careful character sanitization for compliance
- **Error Handling**: Auto-publishing should fail silently to avoid notification spam while logging errors

### Impact Assessment
- **Existing Tasks**: No breaking changes; enhanced foundation for Phase 4 (MQTT â†’ Obsidian)
- **Architecture**: Complete outgoing data flow with both manual and automatic publishing paths
- **Performance**: Debouncing system ensures efficient MQTT usage without spam
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with Obsidian workflow including command palette

### Quality Improvements
- **Auto-Publishing**: Intelligent debouncing prevents MQTT broker spam
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and performance degradation
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of MQTT disconnections and parsing errors
- **User Feedback**: Comprehensive notification system for publishing operations
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation between manual and automatic publishing workflows

### Lessons Learned
- **Debouncing Strategy**: Per-file debouncing with Map tracking is more efficient than global debouncing
- **Event Listener Cleanup**: Critical to prevent memory leaks and plugin conflicts
- **Auto-Publish Logic**: Should respect user settings and fail gracefully without user disruption
- **MQTT Integration**: Connection status checks prevent unnecessary error scenarios
- **Frontmatter Handling**: Custom parsing provides better control than external YAML dependencies

- **Comprehensive Payload Support**: Support for all payload formats (string, JSON, number, boolean, array, nested objects)

### Reason for Changes
Phase 4 implementation revealed critical architectural requirements for production-ready bidirectional MQTT communication:

1. **Loop Prevention**: Essential mechanism to prevent infinite loops between publishing and subscribing
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Need for sophisticated test suite with mock environment and real-world scenario validation
3. **Message Routing**: Requirement for intelligent message routing system in main plugin with validation and error handling
4. **Payload Diversity**: Need to handle all possible MQTT payload formats with proper sanitization and formatting

### Implementation Discoveries
- **Loop Prevention Strategy**: Notes created from MQTT messages must use `mqtt_source:true` instead of `mqtt:true` to prevent loops
- **Topic Separation**: Outgoing and incoming topic patterns must be clearly separated to prevent message loops
- **Mock Environment**: Comprehensive mock Obsidian environment required for isolated testing without plugin dependencies
- **Message Validation**: All incoming messages require validation for topic, payload, and settings configuration
- **Performance Monitoring**: End-to-end testing requires performance thresholds and timing analysis
